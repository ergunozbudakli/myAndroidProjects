# Welcome to my AndroidProjects!

Hey there! I'm **Ergun Ozbdakli** and I am a Software Engineer. Here you can see all of my **android applications**.

- **TravelBook**
 Here you can see one of my android applications. This one is called TravelBook. TravelBook basically allows you to save adresses of the places that you want to save for later use. The application uses **google map** and it shows where you are when you first open the app. If you want to add a place to your list, you just have to click the location for a little while. After you click it for a couple of seconds, a screen will come out that will help you to write the name of the location that you are saving. If you want to delete a saved location, all you have to do is press for a while on the location that you saved with a name before and that's it. Application is also sensitive to not saving the same place twice and not saving them without a name. So, enjoy it!

- **Catch to Kenny**
This one is called **CatchtoKenny**. CatchtoKenny is a very basic game in which gamer tries to  touch Kenny which changes its place continously in 30 seconds. The game saves the highest score if you achieve to catch Kenny more than you did the last time. So let's play and see if you can make more than 43. That was our best score so far :)
